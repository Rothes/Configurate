==================
Configurate Extras
==================

This section of the repository contains extra modules that provide integrations between Configurate and various libraries.

DataFixerUpper
    Integration with Mojang's `DataFixerUpper <https://github.com/Mojang/DataFixerUpper>`_ library. We have separate modules for versions 2 through 4 and 7 of the library, though new features will only be added to the module for the latest library version.

    DataFixerUpper v5 should be equally compatible with the module for v4.
    DataFixerUpper v8 should be equally compatible with the module for v7.

Guice
    Support for using a Guice injector to create object instances in an ObjectMapper.

Kotlin
    Extension functions to make working with Configurate on Kotlin easier.
